Too many times, we are seen as the blueprint for culture, movements, humanity itself, and yet, we are not respected. We are discarded and forgotten and our cries are ignored. This narrative needs to change. We deserve to be seen, heard and loved, consistently & unconditionallyPlease note; We\u2019re peacefully protesting and not enticing violence during this march. We will be LOUD! We will be giving Breonna the attention she deserves on her birthday!! We will be demanding justice for her and to bring her killers to jail!!Along with our being peaceful, we will also use this time to act. As a collective, there are several ways to bring Breonna justice.
