This is the first step in achieving safety and accountability for our black neighbors. We only need 7 more Aldermen to stop withholding their support.\u200b\u200bAlderman Tom Tunney (44th Ward) and Michele Smith (43rd ward) are two of them. They currently do not support CPAC, instead favoring GAPA (\u201cGrassroots\u201d Alliance for Police Accountability.) GAPA keeps the power with the Mayor and the police, leaving your black neighbors vulnerable to police officers like Officer David Diaz and Mike Pulaski. (For full story see: EndLakeviewRacism.Com )\u200bFollowing George Floyd\u2019s murder many Lakeview Neighbors have emailed Tom Tunny to plead with him to support the CPAC. On Friday June 5th, Tunney doubled down and remained a supporter of GAPA. It is time to make our voices heard. March with us.\u200bIf you cannot join our protest:Call and demand he support this initiative immediately: (773) 525-6034\u200b\u200bEmail him using the following template:To the Alderman________, my name is ________ and I live at _________. I am writing you pleading for you to support CPAC \u2013 the Civilian Police Accountability Council, I am certain I do not have to explain to you the severe relevance and urgent need for your support on the enactment of this ordinance that would create a democratically-elected council to oversee CPD.

This is one small step towards ending the pandemic of racist police brutality and allowing citizens to hold officers accountable.
