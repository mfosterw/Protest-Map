This is your chance to do that: a quiet, socially-distanced display of our concern and anguish and our demand for change, happening here in our own neighborhood.We\u20261)Stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matters2)Demand justice for George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery & all other victims.3)Demand a stop to police attacks on protesters4)Immediate accountability for the officers involved in the attack on two Black women in the Brickyard Mall on May 31st.Starting at the SW corner of Lincoln Ave and Sunnyside (across the street from Gideon Welles), protesters will social distance 6 \u2013 10\u2019 apart with the goal to ring Welles Park facing the street with our signs (preferably with messages on both sides). We don\u2019t plan on chanting as that raises the risk for spreading Covid. A silent protest is powerful. We do not plan to march.For those who are higher risk for Covid or are concerned about being around too many people, we encourage a car caravan around the park as well.All participants must wear masks and social distance. This is a peaceful action. We would love for families to attend and show their support. We do not support any violence or property destruction!", "epoch_time": 1591547400}, "geometry": {"type": "Point", "coordinates": [-87.6849975, 41.9631819]}}, {"type": "Feature", "properties": {"id": 2, "title": "Chatham Peace Walk & Food Giveaway", "time_info": "June 7, 2020 - 10 AM", "latitude": "41.7514615", "longitude": "-87.6049795", "location": "79th & Cottage, Chicago, Illinois 60619", "url": "https://www.protestchicago.com/2020/06/06/chatham-peace-walk-food-giveaway/", "notes": "It\u2019s been noisy over here.
