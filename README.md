# Protest-Map
A map of protests (particularly in response to the death of George Floyd) which hopes to be nationwide but currently only serves Chicago through protestchicago.com. Designed to help people find events near them. Locations are obtained based on a google maps search of where the website says they are and are not guaranteed to be accurate.
